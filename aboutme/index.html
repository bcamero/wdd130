    <h2>Cameron Barrett</h2>
    <p>My name is Cameron. I live in north Texas and am currently enrolled in the Applied Business Management Degree.</p>
    <p>I'm trying to save enough money to move to Idaho so that I can switch degrees. I don't really have any hobbies</p>
    <p>because I'm always at work or doing my homework, but I use to play the guitar everyday before I became</p>
    <p>so busy. I have been a member of the church all of my life and my favorite scripture is when Peter testified</p>
    <p>that Jesus is the Messiah in John 6: 66-71.</p>
